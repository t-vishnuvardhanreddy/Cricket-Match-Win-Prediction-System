# Cricket Match Win Prediction System

A Java-based application that dynamically calculates and displays real-time match progress and win probabilities for both teams. It collects key match metrics such as total overs, current score, and run rate, and uses predictive algorithms to estimate the likely outcome of the match.

---

## Features

- Calculates real-time run rate, required run rate, and estimated final score  
- Predicts win probability based on current game conditions  
- Takes dynamic user input (overs, runs, wickets, etc.)  
- Applies basic prediction logic and math utilities  
- Built using core Java without external libraries  

---

## Tools & Technologies

Programming Tools and Libraries:  
- Java Development Kit (JDK) – for compiling and running the application  
- Java Scanner Class – to accept dynamic input from users  

Core Concepts Used:  
- Control Statements (if-else, switch, loops)  
- Exception Handling (try-catch for safe input)  
- Functions / Methods (modular approach for calculations)  

Development Tools:  
- IDE: VS Code  
- Version Control: Git and GitHub for source management

## Algorithms Used

1. Arithmetic Algorithm  
   Basic calculations for current run rate, required run rate, and projected scores.  

2. Prediction Algorithm  
   Estimates winning chances based on overs left, wickets in hand, and required run rate.  

3. Built-in Math Utilities  
   Java's Math class is used for calculations like rounding and projections.
